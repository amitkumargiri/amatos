# AMATOS
I have started this project with something in my mind say "Can we really clone this universal system? Can we predict the future using butterfly effect phenomenon?". Well, we will not come to know until we don't try. I am coding this system in SCALA as we require OOP and functional behaviour both.

# Why This Idea?
I am programmer with 5 years of coding experience and I am curious about this nature's functioning system and trying to mimic it. You can say that it is one of the crazy things but you are in bad luck that I am also a crazy person with infinite imagination.

# Do you want to contribute?
Well, just clone it and start coding. But you have to write comments and explanation of it. I accept that everybody has unique mindset and can have different concept about the system we are trying to write. For example, I don't belive in GOD but you might be believing in your religion and can code that in this system. But you have to give its proper explanation over the class and abouts its functional behaviour above the methods. Similarly, some spiritual beliving person can code spiritual classes and its behaviour but you have to give its proper explanation, then only I will merge it into the master.

# Version
Current Version: v1.0

# Future Use
I don't know yet but I have some idea where I will use it. It will use in Social Media Websites. How? Well, thats a secret I won't be revealing now.
